WORA(Write Once Run Anywhere)
Java is Platform independent
-> byte code -> Across all the platforms, Windows, Mac, Linux
-> byte code can be understood by the JVM not by the normal users
-> along with JDK, JVM also will be there and JRE as well 
-> if any device is having JDK we can run the .class file in that. 
-> .class file contains byte codes
Note: .class file itself is not platform independent, but the byte code which is available within the .class file.
-> while executing .class file in other platforms(OS) we dont need to change the source code according to the system architecture, Thanks to byte code and JVM.
